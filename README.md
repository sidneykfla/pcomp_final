## Demo
1. Clone repository
2. Run <b>python3 project_draft.py True</b> from the command line. Running the code using "True" starts the scheduling programs which make the hunger and thirst levels decrease over time.
3. Enter "feed" when asked <b> How do you want to interact with your rock? </b>.

```
          /---------\ 
        /             \ 
       /               \ 
      /      -   -      \ 
      |                 |
       \       ---     / 
        \             /
          -----------
